  - Get current watch time
  - Read step count
  - Send notification

# Dependancy List

Install Python requirements:

```console
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Install system requirements:

```console
sudo apt-get install python3-dbus
```


# To Run

Pair your PineTime device to your machine with the `bluetoothctl` tool.

Run at the console:

```console
bluetoothctl
```

If your device is already paired, you should see the device with your mac address like this:

```console
[NEW] Device EF:C0:ED:C1:68:52 InfiniTime
```

You can list all of the available bluetoothctl commands by running `help` and you will see the `list`, `scan`, and `pair` commands.

Once you have paired your device and recorded the mac address, run this command to set the time on the PineTime:

```console
python3 sync-pinetime.py PINETIME-MAC-ADDRESS (E.g., EF:C0:ED:C1:68:52)
```
